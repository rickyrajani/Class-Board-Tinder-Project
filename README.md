# Class of 2018 Tinder

This was a quick project I made for Class Board as the Engineering Class Chair and Webmaster. The event was centered around using a Tinder-like concept to match students in our class on Valentineâ€™s Day. When a student filled out a Google form, they listed five peers in their class that they would want to match with. This form was put into this program created with Java that parsed the information. If two students matched with each other, then they would receive a present and message from each other. Otherwise, they would get randomly matched with other students who did not get matches.
